# AuctionHouse

It was a school project I worked on with another colleague, as the
name suggests it was a web auctioning platform</br> 
Users could sell items they own or bid on existing actions, in order to create an auction a
user had to add a description, at least one tag, a starting price, a
deadline for the auction and optionally a picture of the item being
sold, once the deadline was reached a cronjob would run to determine the outcome of the auction</br>

among the features worth mentioning are:</br>
-users would receive personalized emails on certain events (sign up,
auction won, item sold, outbid)</br>
-searching based on keywords or tags</br>
-account verification</br>
-auth system with JWT</br>

the technologies used for this project are: NodeJS+Express, MySql,
React, NextJS</br>

I wrote all the backend code for this project
